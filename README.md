An Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction
For this project, we're going to review the Student Performance dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance
We are going to attempt to predict or classify student final grades using as many of the features in the dataset as
possible in a bid to determine which of these features are the most useful, and which algorithm provides the best
predictions and/or classifications.
The Goal of this project is to compare various Supervised Learning models in a bid to determine which performs best with this dataset.
